## 1. Test Organization
- The tests are organized into logical contexts based on input types (DNs, comma-separated, space-separated, etc.)
- Each context contains multiple test cases covering different scenarios
- The BeforeAll block sets up the testing environment by importing the function and defining a helper

## 2. Helper Function
- Test-WithClipboardInput simplifies testing by handling clipboard operations
- It takes an input string, sets it to the clipboard, and runs the function

## 3. Test Coverage - The tests cover several important scenarios:
- Distinguished Names (single, multiple, with escaped characters)
- Comma-separated values (with various spacing)
- Space-separated values
- Multi-line input (with different line endings)
- Special cases (quotes, mixed delimiters, empty input)
- Sorting functionality

## 4. Best Practices
- Each test has a clear description
- Tests are atomic and independent
- Expected results are explicitly defined
- Edge cases are included

## To use these tests:
1. Save them in a file named ConvertTo-PowerShellArray.Tests.ps1
2. Make sure it's in the same directory as your function file
3. Run the tests using Pester:

```powershell
# Install Pester if you haven't already
Install-Module -Name Pester -Force -SkipPublisherCheck

# Run the tests
Invoke-Pester .\ConvertTo-PowerShellArray.Tests.ps1
```
